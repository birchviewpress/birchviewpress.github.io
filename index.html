<h3>Excerpt from Rice Paper Memoirs:</h3>
<p>
    The earliest memory I have is of my grandmother. She was my father’s mother and lived with us for as long as I can remember.
    Her name was Li Yangrong (李楊榮) and she was born in 1867, during the Qing dynasty, in a little village called Kwotien
    located south of the city of Kaifeng in Henan Province in north central China. She had given birth to two daughters before
    my father was born. Later in her life, when she was a widow, she was referred to as Lady Li Yang, but we called her Nai-Nai.</p>
    <p>My grandmother was short and quite slender. As a child, her feet had been bound, which was traditional for girls at the
    time. By the time I knew her, she wore her graying hair in a bun on the back of her head, a style that was customary
    for older, married women in China. She was the matriarch of our household and was feared and respected by family members
    and servants alike. My grandmother often took me with her to visit her friends, or to the local railroad station where
    we watched trains speeding by. I always wondered where they were going, and wished that someday I would be able to ride
    the train to faraway places.</p>
